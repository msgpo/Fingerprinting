## CK's fingerprinting repo (short: CKFR)

This repo is mainly designed to debunk myths around Browser based fingerprinting and is an ongoing work-in-progress repo to explain which fingerprinting attacks are dangerous, how they work and how to avoid been tracked. The idea and repo was already long time ago created but I had no time to work on it, back in Jan. 2019 I also lost several documents/ideas and already written down papers on this, so I basically start over with fresh ideas and information regarding fingerprinting. 

**There will be no _final version_ because Browsers browser evolve and so does fingerprinting evolves from time to time.**

### Project Goal
* Provide some interesting information around browser based fingerprinting.
* Explain how certain fingerprinting techniques are working, and provide some technical insights.
* Debunk some misinformation regarding fingerprinting
* Upload some research around well-known or even new fingerprinting techniques
* Provide a documentation which can be printed out or exported as .pdf (_maybe_)
